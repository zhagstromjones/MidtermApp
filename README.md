MidtermApp.py

This application allows the user to input a string of characters of any size, which is then encrypted using the SHA-256 encryption algorithm with a generated key. The program displays the ciphertext of the input string along with its hash, then decrypts the string using the generated key. The hashes of both the input and the output are compared and if they match, the program returns "Hash match"; if they do not, the program outputs "Hash mismatch".

This program displays the properties of the CIA triad by ensuring that the information in the message has been secured and is only visible to those who have the key (confidentiality), ensuring that the encrypted message is not tampered with in any way (integrity), and that both interested parties can access the information using their keys (availability).
