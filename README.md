This application allows the user to input a string of characters of any size, which is then encrypted using the SHA-256 encryption algorithm with a generated key. The program displays the ciphertext of the input string along with its hash, then decrypts the string using the generated key. The hashes of both the input and the output are compared and if they match, the program returns "Hash match"; if they do not, the program outputs "Hash mismatch".

This program displays the properties of the CIA triad by ensuring that the information in the message has been secured and is only visible to those who have the key (confidentiality), ensuring that the encrypted message is not tampered with in any way (integrity), and that both interested parties can access the information using their keys (availability). The program accomplishes this by generating a key using the cryptography Python library and using the hashlib library to encrypt the message using they key.

Entropy is the amount of randomness that exists within a defined space. In terms of computing, entropy can be utilized by using random number generators that pull numbers from various user-generated sources. Entropy can be used to generate encryption keys that allow users to decrypt data that has been encrypted by these keys. The keys are used to "scramble" the data into tiny bits that do not make any sense until they are unscrambled and placed back into a logical order.
